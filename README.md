A full stack web application project that allows users to create and share recipes. This project uses React JS and Boostrap for a quick & seamless component and element built front-end UI. 

Recipe data is stored and built using MongoDb through its NoSQL API model with Express as the routing middleware. 

Users are able to register and subscribe through a timed pop up or out of their own interest using Google's Firebase authentication and registration/subscription.
