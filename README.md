YumBuns is a personal project implementing ReactJS's Create React App environment, Google's Firebase Authentication, and AWS's EC2 Hosting and Deployment.

A full stack web application project that allows users to create and share recipes. This project uses React JS and Boostrap for a quick & seamless component and element built front-end UI. 

Recipe data is stored and built using MongoDb through its NoSQL query API model - using Express as the routing middleware. 

Users are able to register and subscribe through a timed pop up or out of their own interest using Google's Firebase authentication and registration/subscription.
