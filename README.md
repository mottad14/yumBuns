The current version of YumBuns can be found on an AWS EC2 Instance at the following link: http://ec2-18-191-144-79.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ 

YumBuns seeks to offer an easy and simple way to create and share recipes online, with an easy to read interface that holds recipe's ingredients and instructions. 

This is a personal project implementing ReactJS's Create React App environment, Google's Firebase Authentication, and AWS's EC2 Hosting and Deployment.


# In my most updated Version

This project uses React JS and Boostrap for a quick & seamless component and element built front-end UI. Incorporating React Router DOM for routing and parameters (RouterDOM v5 and React v17) allows for an easy way to access our models built using Mongoose and stored on MongoDB. 

Recipe data is stored and built using MongoDb through its NoSQL query API model - using Express as routing middleware. 

Users are able to register and log in using Google's Firebase authentication service, as well as edit or delete recipes that are acreddited to their Firebase User ID ie that they created.
